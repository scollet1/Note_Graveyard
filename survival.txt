# On Reward Functions for Survival - Naoto Yoshida

  At each time step t, the agent receives an observation o_t from the state s_t by the observation prob. It replied with action a_t
  The state of the env changed to s' and the agent receives a reward r_t = r(s_t, a_t)

  The agent uses a sequence of observations and actions - called a history h_t = {o_0, a_o, o_1, a_1, ...}

  how the agent reacts in the environment can be described by a probability Ï€(a|h) called the policy.
